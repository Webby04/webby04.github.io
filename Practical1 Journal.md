### Estimated Hours
I spent about 30 minutes of my own time this week on the subject content which included the LinkedIn Learning Courses.

### Content Insights
Creating a basic static website was a good introduction to web design fundamentals, as it helped me understand how websites are created using Bootstrap. It was interesting to learn how to design a website with Bootstrap, as it allows you to create structured and responsive layouts with minimal CSS. I used the Bootstrap website to help develop my website and incorporated components such as the navbar, cards, and buttons to structure the pages. This practical task improved my understanding of how websites like Bootstrap provide ready-made components and layouts that simplify website creation, and it helped me feel more confident in designing a functional and visually appealing website.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to look at the LinkedIn Learning course on web design and development to see if it provided additional insights beyond what I learned while building my basic website. The course helped me better understand the key concepts such as how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create websites. I also learned more about areas like user experience (UX) and website planning, which helped me understand how to create websites that are easier for users to navigate. From this learning strategy, I found that watching the LinkedIn videos before completing the practical task would be more beneficial, as I could apply those skills during the practical work.
